Boston Marathon Raw Data
==================================================

This repository contains, as close as I can manage, all of the data on the Boston Marathon
available from baa.org. It also contains a python notebook for exploration of that data.

The Data
--------------------------------------

Look in the results/{year}/results.csv directories for the data. Do something interesting with
it, and make sure you [tell me about it](bill.mill@gmail.com)!

Downloading The Data
--------------------------------------

I... already did that for you. Why do you want to do that?

Anyway, if you do, you'll want to run `python multidl.py {year}`

Viewing the notebook
--------------------------------------

1. Install the prerequisites: `pip install < requirements.txt`
2. Start the notebook: `make notebook`
3. Play!
